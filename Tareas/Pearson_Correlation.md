What is pair programming?

It requires two programmers to participate in a combined development effort at one job site. The person who is doing the coding is given the controller name while the person who is directing is called the browser. It is often suggested that the two partners switch roles at least every half hour or after a unit test is done. Ideally, the workspace should also accommodate the specific requirements of pair programming. Each worker must have their own mouse, keyboard and screen, which will always show the same information as the colleague's. Somewhat less common is the method called remote pair programming. In this case, the programmers do not sit together, but are located in completely different places. For this method to work, you must have special technical solutions. Even despite the distance, colleagues must have a direct line of communication and must be able to access the code and view modifications in real time.
In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker can pass on their knowledge to their younger colleagues directly through practice. For their part, a younger worker may come up with other ideas, perhaps more innovative, that they can contribute to the project.
