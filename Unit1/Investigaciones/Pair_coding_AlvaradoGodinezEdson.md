# Pair Coding
> Alvarado Godinez Edson

## Definition
The method known as pair programming is used mainly in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). 
Pair programming specifies that there are always two people working on the code at the same time, and that they sit together as much as possible.
One is in charge of writing the code and the other of supervising it in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions:
they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

Usually, these two workers are assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role is responsible for writing the code. 
The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role supervises that code. One of the rules of pair programming states that these two roles are exchanged 
regularly (at short intervals). In this way, a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and a fluid exchange of roles 
is achieved.

## Advantages
* The number of errors is reduced.
* Increased creativity.
* Troubleshooting in less time.
* More efficient work.
* Shared experience.

## Disadvantages
* A project progresses slower than when 2 programmers do different tasks.
* Increase in personnel costs.
* Possible lack of affinity between the team.
