# Pearson Correlation
> Alvarado Godinez Edson

## Definition
Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. 
If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.
The correlation coefficient can take a range of values from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. 
A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other.
A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:

* The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.
* The variables must be roughly distributed.
* The association must be linear.
* There should be no outliers in the data.

Where: "x" is equal to variable number one, "y" belongs to variable number two, "zx" is the standard deviation of variable one, 
"zy" is the standard deviation of variable two and "N" is is number of data.
